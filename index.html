        <h2>Section One</h2>
        <p>God has given us the most valuable and precious gift: Nature. Nature serves as a bridge between the physical world outside of us and the life within. For all living organisms on the earth, it is the primary source of all needed nutrients. Nature includes all we can see in our immediate environment, including the sun, moon, trees, fruits, flowers, birds, people animals, etc. Every creature depends on one another and is interconnected for survival. To survive, humans, for instance, are dependent on nature, which gives us everything like oxygen, food, water, shelter, medications, and clothing. Nature is very crucial to keep the expansion and harmony of life on earth.</p>

        <p>The study of birds is called ornithology, and bird diversity is so immense that no one can even guess the exact number and variety of birds in the world.

            There are approximately 10,000 different types of birds in the world. Scientists believe that there are even more that may not yet be discovered or classified.
            
            
            Birds are found on every continent and in every type of habitat, from the Arctic to the tropical regions. Their colors are also diverse and awesome.
            
            
            Some common kinds of birds include ducks, chickens, hawks, eagles, finches, sparrows, and crows. Every bird has its own unique characteristics, but all birds share some common features.
            
            For example, all birds can fly (except for a few bird species that have lost the ability to do so), and all have feathers. Their wings give them the ability to fly, which is one of the things that sets them apart from other animals.</p>

        <p>A horse is a vegetarian and domestic animal. It is very beneficial as well. A horse has four feet, two eyes, a nose, two ears and a tail. Their feet are quite slim but really strong. It allows them to run fast and for long.

            Moreover, one can find horses in different sizes, colours and shapes. All this depends on their breed and genes. In addition, the quality and quantity they eat daily also impact their health.
            
            Horses are in many colours. There are white, red, brown, black, grey horses and also sometimes they have a mixture of colours. Almost every country in the world has horses. The Arabian horse is popular for running very fast.
            
            Foals are young horses or baby horses. A mother horse gives birth to one foal at a time. About 5000 years ago, horses managed to domesticate humans. A horse lives up to 25 to 30 years. However, it does depend on their living condition.</p>
